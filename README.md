# reticulate_on_singularity_example_2

Example 2 of using reticulate within a Singularity container.

Thanks to [myoung3](https://github.com/myoung3) for his
[advice](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate/issues/1044#issuecomment-1026915671)
to use the Singularity file at [here](https://github.com/kaufman-lab/build_containers/blob/main/definition_files/geospatial_plus_ml__4.1.0.def).

This repository builds a container using that file.
